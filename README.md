# meshtastic-bot
A lightweight multi-purpose Meshtastic utility bot designed to run on a Raspberry Pi connected to a Heltec T114 (or any Meshtastic device via USB).  This bot listens and responds only on a specific channel (channelIndex = 1), making it ideal for private groups or community mesh networks.
